# This is a project based on C language that uses the KNN algorithm to realize handwritten digit recognition.

## Why the mian file end with .cpp not .c?

Because the libary EasyX **only work on the C++ language**, so we need to use the C++ compiler to compile it.But the grammer we used is **C**.If you can use a **C based GUI library**, you can use the C compiler to compile the project.

## Somechange in Leatest update

In the latest update,we add an args,it's default value is 0 which means the program will run without GUI.So that you can compil it with C compiler and run it on the command line.If you want to run it with GUI,you can set the args to 1.

## What is KNN?

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. In this project, we will use KNN to classify handwritten digits.

## How does KNN work?

1.For a given unlabeled sample, calculate its distance from all labeled samples in the training set.

2.Select the K nearest neighbors from the training set based on the calculated distance.

3.Assign the label of the majority of the K nearest neighbors to the unlabeled sample.

4.For classification problems, a voting mechanism is used to decide the category of unlabeled samples, that is, the most common category among K neighbors is selected as the category of the sample.

5.For regression problems, the average value rule is adopted, that is, the average value of K neighbors is selected as the regression value of the sample.

## what environment we used?

> Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

## Core algorithms

```C
typedef struct data
{
    int label;
    int feature[MAX_DIGIT];
    struct data *next = NULL;
} DATA;

float Eucliden_Distance(DATA *pdata,DATA *ptrain)
{
    int i = 0;
    float distance = -1;
    while (i < MAX_DIGIT)
    {
        distance += pow(pdata->feature[i] - ptrain->feature[i], 2);
        i++;
    }
    distance = sqrt(distance);

    return distance;
}
```
